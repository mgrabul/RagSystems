\section{Introduction}
As you can see for the title of the paper you must use 16pt, Centered, Bold, Times New Roman.
Leave one blank line and then type AUTHORS' NAMES (in Capital, 12pt Times New Roman,
centered), Department (in 12pt Times New Roman, centered), University (in 12pt Times New Roman,
centered), Address (in 12pt Times New Roman, centered), COUNTRY (in Capital, 12pt Times New
Roman, centered). Then you must type your e-mail address and your Web Site address (both in 12pt
Times New Roman, centered). 
The heading of each section should be printed in small, 14pt, left justified, bold, Times New Roman.
You must use numbers 1, 2, 3, … for the sections' numbering and not Latin numbering (I, II, III, …)

\section{Problem Formulation}
Please, leave two blank lines between successive sections as here.

Mathematical Equations must be numbered as follows: (1), (2), $\ldots$, (99) and not (1.1), (1.2), $\ldots$, (2.1), (2.2), $\ldots$  depending on your various Sections.

\subsection{Subsection}
When including a subsection you must use, for its heading, small letters, 12pt, left justified, bold, Times New Roman as here.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection}
When including a sub-subsection you must use, for its heading, small letters, 11pt, left justified, bold, Times New Roman as here. 

\section{Problem Solution}
Figures and Tables should be numbered as follows: Fig.1, Fig.2, $\ldots$ etc Table 1, Table 2, $\ldots$ etc.
\break

If your paper deviates significantly from these specifications, our Publishing House may not be able to include your paper in the Proceedings. 
\break

When citing references in the text of the abstract, type the corresponding number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{cite1}.  
\break

The authors are required to look over and verify whether the in-text citations exist in the reference list and whether all the references mentioned in the reference list exist in the in-text citations. 
\break

Also, they need to look over if the in-text citations of the Tables, Equations and Figures are properly connected with the Tables, Equations and Figures.

\section{Conclusion}
Please, follow our instructions faithfully, otherwise you have to resubmit your full paper.  This will \pagebreak  enable us to maintain uniformity in the conference proceedings as well as in the post-conference luxurious books by Press. Thank you for your cooperation and contribution. We are looking forward to seeing you at the Conference.
