The total length of the Great Wall, including all its branches, is approximately 21,196 kilometers. The Great Wall is not a single continuous structure but a series of walls and fortifications built by different dynasties over centuries.

The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, India, and was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction of the Taj Mahal started in 1632 and was completed in 1653.

Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, has a peak at 8,848.86 meters above sea level. The mountain is located on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.

The first successful ascent of Mount Everest was by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on May 29, 1953. Mount Everest is part of the Himalayan range and is known as "Sagarmatha" in Nepal and "Chomolungma" in Tibet.

The summit of Mount Everest marks the highest point on Earth’s surface, often referred to as "the roof of the world." The atmospheric pressure at the summit is only about one-third of that at sea level, making breathing extremely difficult without supplemental oxygen.

The Amazon Rainforest, also known as Amazonia, is the largest rainforest in the world, covering approximately 5.5 million square kilometers. The Amazon River, which flows through the rainforest, is the second-longest river in the world, stretching over 7,000 kilometers.

The Amazon Rainforest is often referred to as "the lungs of the Earth" because it produces about 20% of the world’s oxygen. The rainforest is home to an estimated 390 billion individual trees and about 16,000 species.

The Amazon Rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot, home to about 10% of the known species on Earth, including jaguars, sloths, and various types of monkeys. Deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest is a significant environmental concern, with large areas being cleared for agriculture, logging, and mining.

The Grand Canyon, carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, USA, is 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and attains a depth of over a mile. The Grand Canyon is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

The rock layers in the Grand Canyon reveal nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history. The canyon is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most visited national parks in the United States.

The temperature at the bottom of the Grand Canyon can be significantly higher than at the rim, sometimes by over 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).

The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world, stretching over 2,300 kilometers along the northeast coast of Australia. The reef is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

The Great Barrier Reef is the only living structure visible from space. The reef is home to a diverse array of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 411 types of hard coral, and dozens of species of sharks and rays.

The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. Climate change, particularly ocean warming, poses a significant threat to the reef, leading to widespread coral bleaching.

Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls located on the border between Ontario, Canada, and New York, USA. The three waterfalls that make up Niagara Falls are Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls.

Horseshoe Falls is the largest of the three, with a height of 51 meters and a width of 790 meters. Niagara Falls has the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America, with over 2,800 cubic meters of water flowing over the falls every second during peak flow.

Niagara Falls was formed approximately 12,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The falls remain a popular tourist destination, attracting over 30 million visitors each year.

The Pyramids of Giza, located near Cairo, Egypt, were built as tombs for the Pharaohs of Egypt. The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is the largest and oldest of the three pyramids, originally standing at 146.6 meters.
